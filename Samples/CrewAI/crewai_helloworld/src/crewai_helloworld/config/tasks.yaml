design_architecture_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the requirements for {topic} and design a comprehensive 
    agentic AI architecture. Identify the necessary agents, their 
    specific tools, the communication patterns (e.g., sequential, 
    hierarchical, or joint-task), and the state management approach. 
    Ensure the design addresses scalability and technical constraints 
    relevant to the year 2026.
  expected_output: >
    A formal architectural blueprint including:
    1. System Overview
    2. Agent Definitions & Personas
    3. Tooling & Integration Requirements
    4. Orchestration Logic & Error Handling Strategies

critique_and_audit_task:
  description: >
    Review the architectural blueprint provided by the Architect. 
    Perform a "Red Team" analysis to identify potential failure points 
    such as security vulnerabilities (prompt injection), API cost 
    inefficiencies, and integration bottlenecks with enterprise systems. 
    Provide specific, actionable recommendations to harden the 
    architecture for production use.
  expected_output: >
    An Enterprise Audit Report formatted in Markdown (without code blocks). 
    The report must include a "Risk vs. Feasibility" score, a list of 
    identified architectural gaps, and a final set of hardening 
    recommendations for the {topic} implementation.
